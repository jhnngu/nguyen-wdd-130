                    We want users to be informed about the benefits of intermittent study sessions, by providing users
                    scientific literature for their knowledge, and allow users to implement the technique through the
                    in-built tools, such as the timer, and customized study sessions. Allowing users to track their
                    sessions
                    will motivate long-term progress as well.
