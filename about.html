            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We are a small start-up which all started with a small idea to help improve our lives. We wanted to be
                more productive and improve what we were able to output to society on a daily basis. It first started in
                our college dorms and has now grown to something bigger than we ever dreamed of. </p>
            <p>
                The team is currently a small, but we are ever growing. We believe we are family here and want to
                succeed in our goals which will eventually help others to succeed in their goals. If you are interested
                in our mission and pursuit to help improve the world's human capital, please email us by
                <a href="mailto:this_is_a_fake_email@gmail.com">clicking here</a>.

            <div class="about-right-text">
                <p>I'm the founder and CEO. The idea first came into my head when I was starting college and was
                    researching how to study effectively and be more productive during the day. There was so much
                    information to read and many methods to implement to help me, that I was able to cultivate it all
                    for my own purposes. However, I thought all this information and the tools I used could help others,
                    so I founded Stud-EZ</p>
                <p>
                    Now a bit about myself. I love learning and have an insatiable ger for knowledge which, has led me
                    down this path. I'm a huge dog person and have a 6 year old whippet, who is such a good boye. I'm
                    also a huge sports fan; I love to watch MMA, Tennis, Basketball, and Formula 1.

            <div class="about-left-text">
                <p>In order for this project to become a reality, John needed some technical know how. Here comes me,
                    Steve. I was John's roommate during college and we've been inseperable ever since. John pitched me
                    the idea and it sounde like a fun project for me to practice my developer skills on. As we
                    progressed further, I realized that we wre onto something big here and we've kept this going further
                    and further and we hope it grows bigger than we ever dreamed of. </p>
                <p>As for me personally, I'm your typical nerd and geek. I love gaming and I'm a huge FPS player; I've
                    even won a few small professional competitions. I'm also a bit of a otaku, as I watch a lot of anime
                    and read a lot of manga</p>

                <p>For the every growing project, we needed someone to manage the team. Meet me, Rachel! I joined the
                    team in 2019 and I was instantly drawn to John & Steve's energy. Their positivity and belief in
                    their goals helped me realize that I could definitely contribute to this project. I've always loved
                    interacting with people and so human resources became my career.</p>
                <p>In my spare time I love music and have always pursued that as a hobby in my own time. I play multiple
                    instruments, mainly guitar and piano, and I write and record my own songs!</p>
