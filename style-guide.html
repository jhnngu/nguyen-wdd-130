        <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
        <p>
            My name is John and I make websites. I don’t know about you, but I’ve
            always had trouble with studying long periods of time, until I found out
            the Pomodoro Technique, which is where you study for 25-minute sessions
            and have 5-minute breaks. After 4 study sessions, you take a 30-minute
            break. <br />
            Although it did help me study for longer, the 25-minute sessions didn’t
            feel long enough to gain momentum and the 5-minute breaks weren’t long
            enough to have anything fun. This is when I found the Animedoro
            Technique, where you study for 60 minutes and then watch an episode of
            anime (20-minute break). This amount of time allowed me to gain a lot of
            momentum in my studies and also have a meaningful length break, while
            also watching my favorite anime.<br />
            I tried to find an app that would help me track my study sessions, but
            these apps would only track pomodoro sessions. This is why I want to
            make a website that tracks custom study sessions; you can choose the
            length of your study sessions, short-breaks, long breaks, the number of
            study sessions until your long breaks, and how many study sessions
            you’ve done; this website will give you feedback and will track your
            productivity! Please replace this text with your Elevator Pitch.

        <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
        <p>
            To provide a service that allows people to be more productiveEveryone
            strives to be more productive, but most people don’t know how or where
            to start. This website will provide them the structure they need to be
            more productive and ensure that productivity is sustainable and
            motivating as well.<br />
            We want users to be informed about the benefits of intermittent study
            sessions, by providing users scientific literature for their knowledge,
            and allow users to implement the technique through the in-built tools,
            such as the timer, and customized study sessions. Allowing users to
            track their sessions will motivate long-term progress as well.<br />
            By providing these tools and information, we are allowing users to
            achieve their goals, whether that be in their studies, careers, or
            personal life.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Audience Statement</h2>
        <p> The main target demographic of this website would be mainly for students
            of all ages and demographics but, with the customized nature of it, the
            audience can be anyone who is looking to increase and track their
            productivity, while also being sustainable as well.</p>
        <p>
        <p>As a student myself and being surrounded by others, students can lack structure and
            discipline. The website will allow people to give structure to the
            user’s study/productivity sessions and allowing for sustainable,
            long-term productivity.</p>
        <p>
            Our demographic will mainly access this via the
            web app. A mobile application may be implemented at a later date, but a
            web application allows for universal access across all devices.
        </p>

        <h2>Misson Statement</h2>∏
        <p>
            Our mission is to enhance human capital.
            There is no financial goal with this website; what the website is to be is a tool to allow people to
            flourish and be at their best and achieve their goals, whether that be personal or career goals.
            To enhance discipline is to enhance one’s life. As one achieves more goals and is disciplined in doing so,
            more of their time is freed up for other important aspects of their lives, while also allowing them to reach
            their potential.
            By helping individuals achieve more of what they want, the benefits will radiate outwards to those around
            them. Humans are networked individuals and to help one is to help many.
