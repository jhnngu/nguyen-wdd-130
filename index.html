            <h3>Purpose Satement</h3>
            <p>Everyone strives to be more productive, but most people don’t know how or where to start. This website
                will provide them the structure they need to be more productive and ensure that productivity is
                sustainable and motivating as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                We want users to be informed about the benefits of intermittent study sessions, by providing users
                scientific literature for their knowledge, and allow users to implement the technique through the
                in-built tools, such as the timer, and customized study sessions. Allowing users to track their sessions
                will motivate long-term progress as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                By providing these tools and information, we are allowing users to achieve their goals, whether that be
                in their studies, careers, or personal life.

            <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
            <p>
                There is no financial goal with this website; what the website is to be is a tool to allow people to
                flourish and be at their best and achieve their goals, whether that be personal or career goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                To enhance discipline is to enhance one’s life. As one achieves more goals and is disciplined in doing
                so, more of their time is freed up for other important aspects of their lives, while also allowing them
                to reach their potential.
            </p>
            <p>
                By helping individuals achieve more of what they want, the benefits will radiate outwards to those
                around them. Humans are networked individuals and to help one is to help many.

            <h3>Audience Statement</h3>
            <p>
                The main target demographic of this website would be mainly for students of all ages and demographics
                but, with the customized nature of it, the audience can be anyone who is looking to increase and track
                their productivity, while also being sustainable as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a student myself and being surrounded by others, students can lack structure and discipline. The
                website will allow people to give structure to the user’s study/productivity sessions and allowing for
                sustainable, long-term productivity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our demographic will mainly access this via the web app. A mobile application may be implemented at a
                later date, but a web application allows for universal access across all devices.
